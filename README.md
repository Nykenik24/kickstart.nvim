# My fork of "kickstart.nvim"

This is my neovim config.\
\
If (for some reason) you want to download it:
> NOTE: Linux only
1. Backup and clean your current configuration
> NOTE: if you don't have a current config skip this step
```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/* ~/.cache/nvim/*
```
2. Clone the config to the `~/.config` directory as `nvim`.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nykenik24/kickstart.nvim ~/.config/nvim
```
